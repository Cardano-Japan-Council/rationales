## Summary  
We consider this governance action to be constitutional.

## Rationale Statement  
This governance action establishes a Net Change Limit (NCL) as a prerequisite for treasury withdrawals, in accordance with the requirements of Article II, Section 7 of the amended Cardano Constitution. The proposal clearly specifies the applicable period, the maximum withdrawal amount, as well as the methodology for calculation and application. It does not approve any specific treasury withdrawal, but instead defines an upper limit to be used when assessing future treasury withdrawal governance actions. In these respects, we find no elements that conflict with the Cardano Constitution. For these reasons, we determine that this governance action is constitutional.
