# Governance Action ID  
`gov_action1x2zm0lgd59kjrc9clzgscdlh0ct62l8llr638h6t4a5jj4yqzzyqq2dgc7q`  

## Summary  
We abstain from a constitutional determination.

## Rationale Statement  
The claim for the outstanding portion of the deposit, 100,000 ADA, in this proposal is justified. However, the claim for 3,000 ADA can be considered unjustified. As opinions within the team were divided, we abstain from making a constitutional judgment.

## Precedent Discussion  
None  

## Counterargument Discussion  
TENET 8 and TENET 9: The redemption of 3,000 ADA, which is not a deposit, is considered personal compensation and is therefore inappropriate. Furthermore, the following content is insufficient as a proposal for a treasury withdrawal.  
(Article 3, Section 5) The explanation of the situation in which the 100,000 ADA could not be recovered (issues related to the relevant wallet or system) is not explicitly stated.  
(Article 4, Section 2) It only states that the administrator is “DRep,” without specifying who will perform which duties.  
(Article 4, Section 5) It does not list a community-auditable receiving address.

## Conclusion  
The request to withdraw 100,000 ADA itself is legitimate, but the 3,000 ADA portion cannot necessarily be deemed constitutional. Furthermore, the information provided is insufficient for a treasury withdrawal governance action. Therefore, we abstain.
