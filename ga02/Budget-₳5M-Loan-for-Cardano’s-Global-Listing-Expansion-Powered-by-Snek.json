The basis for the request is also detailed.Article 4, Section 2: The method for managing funds is clearly stated.Article 4, Section 4: The plan for financial audits is clearly stated.Article 4, Section 5: The administrator is clearly identified as Intersect.However, many details are not explicitly stated, so additional specifics should be added during the financial withdrawal GA.",

Therefore, the proposal must accurately present the following points:・Specifically, while advisory committee members include entities like foundations, this is an undetermined matter (Article 3, Paragraph 5)・There is no mention of the ADA receiving account, nor any description of the smart contract or collateral related to loan repayment (Article 4, Paragraph 4)・While it states Intersect will ultimately be responsible for repayment, there are no specific descriptions regarding repayment (collateral, contract details, repayment methods like smart contracts).( Article 4, Section 5)etc.Furthermore, as this is a high-risk loan, there are concerns regarding its public nature and sustainability.(TENET 9)",
