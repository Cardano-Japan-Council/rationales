`gov_action1jr84r96lnsvu9yd6c0jhxe9gj5r7vnd2pgkntc6klplxdpyzz4tqqc9uldx`

## Summary  
We abstain from issuing a constitutional determination on this governance action.   

## Rationale Statement  
This case is an information action submitted prior to the financial withdrawal proposal, and we focused our review on Articles 3 and 4.
Article 3, Section 5: The format, including the attachment of off-chain content, is properly structured. The basis for the request is also detailed.
Article 4, Section 2: The method for managing funds is clearly stated.
Article 4, Section 4: The plan for financial audits is clearly stated.
Article 4, Section 5: The administrator is clearly identified as Intersect.
However, many details are not explicitly stated, so additional specifics should be added during the financial withdrawal GA.

## Precedent Discussion  
None

## Counterargument Discussion  
This proposal is a plan with unclear details. Therefore, the proposal must accurately present the following points:
・Specifically, while advisory committee members include entities like foundations, this is an undetermined matter (Article 3, Paragraph 5)
・There is no mention of the ADA receiving account, nor any description of the smart contract or collateral related to loan repayment (Article 4, Paragraph 4)
・While it states Intersect will ultimately be responsible for repayment, there are no specific descriptions regarding repayment (collateral, contract details, repayment methods like smart contracts). (Article 4, Section 5)
etc.
Furthermore, as this is a high-risk loan, there are concerns regarding its public nature and sustainability.(TENET 9)

## Conclusion  
Therefore, we abstain. Significant improvements are necessary before this can be submitted as a Withdraw GA.
