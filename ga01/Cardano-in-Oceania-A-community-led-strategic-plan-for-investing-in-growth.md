## Summary  
We consider this governance action to be constitutional.

## Rationale Statement  
This case is an informational action submitted prior to the financial withdrawal proposal, and we examined it with a focus on Articles 3 and 4.
Article 3, Section 5: The format, including the attachment of off-chain content, is properly structured. Furthermore, the basis for the request is detailed and does not conflict with the Constitution.
Article 4, Section 2: The fund manager is designated as Selfdriven, and the management method there is also clearly stated.
Article 4, Section 4: Selfdriven is designated for financial auditing and dispute resolution, and the fee structure is clear.
Article 4, Section 5: Funds are delegated to Auto-Abstain DRep, and SPO non-delegation is specified.
Therefore, it is deemed constitutional.

## Precedent Discussion  
None

## Counterargument Discussion  
Note, as some matters are not explicitly detailed, further specifics should be added during the financial withdrawal GA.

## Conclusion  
Although some specific clarifications were lacking, since there was no clear constitutional violation, we determine it to be constitutional.
