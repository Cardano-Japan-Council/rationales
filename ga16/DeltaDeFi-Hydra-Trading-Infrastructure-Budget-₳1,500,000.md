## Summary  
We consider this governance action to be constitutional.

## Rationale Statement  
This Governance Action is an Info Action intended to provide information regarding Hydra-based DeFi infrastructure within the Cardano ecosystem and its alignment with the Vision 2030 KPIs. It does not authorize any Treasury expenditure, enact any protocol changes, or constrain future voting decisions. As it satisfies the submission requirements set out in Article III, Section 5 of the Constitution and does not violate the Constitution or its associated guardrails, nor does it exceed the scope of an Info Action, this proposal is therefore considered constitutional. In addition, it is noteworthy that the proposer seeks to articulate, in quantitative terms, which areas of the Cardano Vision 2030 their initiative intends to contribute to, and to what extent. Looking ahead, it will be important for the community not only to evaluate such initiatives individually, but also to examine whether the aggregation of these efforts forms a structure through which the Vision can realistically be achieved as a whole.
