    "rationaleStatement": "This governance action has been rigorously reviewed and is deemed constitutional, aligning with the mandate of the Cardano Constitution. The proposal focuses on providing legitimate compensation and operational funding for the Constitutional Committee. Our affirmation is based on compliance with the following key articles: Article 7: The proposal aligns with Article 7, Section 8, which justifies the compensation for committee members' duties. Furthermore, it complies with Article 7, Section 1, ensuring the Committee's independence and procedural integrity. Article 4: The proposal demonstrates adherence to the financial requirements outlined in Article 4 by specifying provisions for fund administration and audit planning. Fund management is structured via a smart contract, ensuring that the funds are auditable, segregated, and transparently controlled.",
    "precedentDiscussion": "None",
    "counterargumentDiscussion": "None",
    "conclusion": "While a formal Treasury Withdrawal proposal would require the explicit inclusion of the receiving stake address and a full audit contract, this action is procedurally and substantively consistent with the constitutional framework in its current form. Therefore, this governance action is judged to be constitutional.",
